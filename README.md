# Not-so-insane dotfiles (ಥ﹏ಥ)

Custom dotfiles that I use with Ubuntu, Pop!_OS & [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 "Windows Subsystem for Linux")

### shell
IMO fish is the best shell out of the box, without any configuration. But it's not [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. So writing scripts in fish is different than bash or zsh. Which is pain sometimes. 

*fish can run bash scripts with `#!/bin/bash` shebang, but there's some
gotchas too*

### editor
neovim 

***tmux for multiple terminal sessions with multiple panes & windows. The perks
are unlimited***
