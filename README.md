# Dotfiles

Custom dotfiles that I use with Ubuntu, PopOs & [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 "Windows Subsystem for Linux")

### shell
IMO fish is the best shell out of the box, without any configuration. But it's not [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. So writing scripts in fish is different than bash or zsh. Which I tend to do a lot. 
*fish can run bash scripts with `#!/bin/bash` shebang, but there's some
gotchas too*

### editor

## For zsh
install zsh <br/>
install oh-my-zsh <br/>
install powerlevel10k <br/>
use Meslo Nerd Font <br/>
p10k configure <br/>
